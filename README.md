```css
.card-container {
    background-color: var(--Dark-Grey);
    margin: 1rem 1.25rem;
    padding:1.25rem 2.2rem ;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    border-radius: 15px;
    width: 450px;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [ Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - This helped me very much. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Resource 2](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
